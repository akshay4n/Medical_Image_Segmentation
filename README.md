Multi-scale self-guided attention for medical image segmentation
<br>
Objectives:<br>
* To provide automatic segmentations of medical images which are of good precision.
* To capture richer contextual dependencies based on the use of guided self-attention mechanism
* To neglect irrelevant information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing relevant feature association
<br>
Datasets:CHAOS Dataset<br>
Methodology:<br>
1. Multiple Scales attention maps
2. Positional Attention Module(PAM)
3. Channel Attention Model (CAM)
